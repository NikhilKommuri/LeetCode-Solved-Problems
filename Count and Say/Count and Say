The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

The above explanataion was very confusing

Below is the explanation which is easily understandable

We simply consider how many times each number has occurred in previous sequence and what is its actual value and we append it to the next sequence.
Like for the case when n = 1, it is simply 1.

1 = 1 
But for the case when n = 2, we can derive the solution from n=1 as we need to measure how many times an item is occurring and what is its value. So in n=1, 1 occurs 1 time and the value is 1.

2 = 11 ( first 1 denotes the number of times 1 occurred in previous sequence and second one is the val)
Same goes for n = 3. The number 1 occurs 2 times in 2nd sequence and the val is 1.

3 = 21( 2 - represent the number of times 1 occurred in previous sequence and 1 means the val)
Similarly for n=4.

4 = 1211( 1 means the occurrence of 2 in previous sequence followed by the value and 2 the val, then 
1 is the frequency of 1 in previous sequence and 1 is the val)
